# 🌸 Iris Classification ML Project (Vertex AI)

This project implements an **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** for classifying Iris flower species using **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Vertex AI**.  
It demonstrates the full lifecycle of an ML model — from data retrieval and training to deployment and inference.

The repository is designed to showcase practical experience with **cloud-based ML workflows**, reproducible pipelines, and model serving.

## 📌 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a classification model that predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its features.

The workflow includes:

1. Data retrieval from **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**
2. Model training and evaluation  
3. Model storage and deployment  
4. Running inference on unseen data
